/*
NOTE:

The teacher's PDF condition doesn't match the database 
the students currently have. For example, the PDF file 
mentions fields and table columns like "group name," 
"student absences," and so on. None of this is present, 
and as the teacher said, that's normal. It's normal 
for the condition to be inconsistent with the database 
you currently have, in which case you WILL have to 
invent an SQL query yourself. So, the solution below 
is my personal interpretation.

How to make your own interpretation of the condition 
applicable to the database: first, you don't need to 
create a new database, nor do you need new tables. 
Then, you apply the PDF condition to the existing database 
so that the functionality is similar, but the names are 
different (because you simply have a different database).

That is, if your condition says "display the number of 
student groups," you do something like "display the 
number of applicants." Thus, the code functionally does 
not differ much, and this is considered an acceptable 
solution.
