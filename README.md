Due to the different encoding in Windows, I can't write comments in Russian directly in the code (this can be seen in one of the early commits, dated October 22, 2025).
When writing the query code, I used Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (21.5.14), so to guarantee proper operation, it's best to use it on your PC (I just don't know how or where else I can do all this properly).

# Building laboratory_work1
This happens in the following order:
1. Run **creating_the_tables.sql**
2. Run **add_constraints.sql**
3. Run **add_relationships.sql**
4. Run **insert_data.sql**

# Building laboratory_work2
This happens in the following order:
0. You need to have the exact **result of running laboratory_work1**
1. Run **insert_data.sql**
2. Run **create_the_views.sql**
